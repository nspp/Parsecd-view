This project is an eclipse project, using the Scala plug in.

However, it is to be compile by hand as far as the version of Scala used
in this project and in the eclipse plug in aren't the same !

A file 'local.properties' is to be created in the root of this project with
the following line :

scala.home='/path/to/scala/library/jars/of/version/11'
